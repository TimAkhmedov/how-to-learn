# **_My first project._**
This project is written using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
Passing through two sprints I have learned basic concept of:  
1. _HTML and CSS._
2._ Flexbox CSS._
3. _CSS positioning._
4. _Methodology of BEM._
5. _How to use GIT._
6. _Animation and transformation._

After code-review this page will be updated according to the remarks of code-reviewer.  
So by right now there is nothing to update and improve. Hope, it will be nothing to redo after code-review.
